The Effects of Physical Crowding and Crowding-Induced Chemical Cues on the Metabolic Activity of Hemigrapsus oregonensis

Coastal development and climate-driven sea level rise are contributing to a phenomenon known as coastal squeeze, which compresses intertidal habitats between rising seas and hardened shorelines. In Seattle, approximately 92% of the coastline is armored, threatening the persistence of native intertidal species such as the hairy shore crab (Hemigrapsus oregonensis). These crabs, already found in dense aggregations, may experience further crowding as their habitat contracts. Increased density is likely to heighten intraspecific aggression and competition, potentially elevating metabolic stress and reducing fitness.

Our project aimed to evaluate the physiological of crowding and crowding-induced chemical cues on H. oregonensis. Specifically, we hypothesized that (1) physical crowding would increase metabolic activity and stress in crabs, and (2) exposure to chemical cues from previously crowded conditions would similarly elevate metabolic demand. To test these hypotheses, we designed a two-trial experiment using resazurin assays to estimate oxygen consumption as a proxy for metabolic rate, and righting response time as a behavioral stress indicator.

In Trial One, crabs were assigned to either a crowded (n=9/200 mL) or uncrowded (n=9/1000 mL) condition for seven days. In Trial Two, crabs were randomly reassigned to either uncrowded treatment which contained diluted water from the crowded treatment in trial one (to simulate chemical cue exposure), or a fresh crowded condition. In both trials, resazurin assays and righting time trials were performed.

Contrary to our initial expectations, uncrowded crabs in Trial One showed the highest rates of oxygen consumption, while crowded crabs exhibited lower respiration rates, possibly due to metabolic suppression from stress or deteriorated condition. Both treatments in trial one had higher oxygen consumption rates than the control. Crabs in the crowded treatment experienced limb loss and mortality, indicating physical conflict, while righting times did not vary significantly across treatments.

In Trial Two, crabs exposed to fresh crowding conditions consumed the most oxygen, suggesting elevated metabolic activity due to physical stress. Crabs exposed to chemical cues via water from the previous crowded tank also showed increased oxygen use relative to controls, though not as high as those physically crowded. Again, average righting times did not differ meaningfully across treatments when comparing across treatments.

Overall, while oxygen consumption patterns partially supported our hypotheses, the lack of consistent results in righting times and the unexpected respiration patterns in uncrowded treatments highlight the complexity of using these metrics to assess stress in H. oregonensis. Despite limitations including small sample sizes, crab escapees, we observed clear signs of stress and aggression in crowded treatments, supporting concerns that increasing crab densities under future shoreline conditions may compromise individual fitness and population resilience.

Future work should incorporate more robust physiological markers (e.g., lactate or cortisol), larger sample sizes, and standardized crab age/sex classes to better understand the consequences of coastal squeeze for intertidal invertebrates such as hairy shore crabs.
